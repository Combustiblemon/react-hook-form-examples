# React-Hook-Form examples with Chakra-UI

---

## Examples:

You can find three examples in the `/pages/` directory:

1. `index.tsx` uses `Chakra-UI` inputs and a custom `Card` input component with custom validation.
2. `simple.tsx` is the same as `index.tsx` but without the array in the `selectedCardIds` field.
3. `yup.tsx` is the same as `simple.tsx` but using `Yup` as a validator.
